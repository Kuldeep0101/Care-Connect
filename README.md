DoctorHub - Online Doctor Appointment Booking Backend
Project Overview

DoctorHub is a backend API for an online doctor appointment booking platform. It allows patients to securely register, search for doctors by specialty or location, and book appointments in real-time. Doctors can manage their profiles, set availability, view appointments, and add prescription notes. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB and focuses on robust authentication and secure data management.
Features Implemented So Far

    Node.js project setup with layered architecture and environment configuration

    MongoDB Atlas connection using Mongoose

    User model supporting both patients and doctors with role differentiation

    Password hashing with bcrypt and secure password comparison methods

    Doctor-specific fields included (specialty, location, ratings, experience, timing)

    Basic groundwork laid for authentication workflows

Tech Stack

    Node.js

    Express.js

    MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose

    bcrypt for password hashing

    dotenv for environment variables
