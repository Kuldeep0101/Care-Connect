Care-Connect - Online Doctor Appointment Booking Backend 🚑🩺
Project Overview 📝

DoctorHub is a backend API for an online doctor appointment booking platform. It allows patients to securely register, search for doctors by specialty or location, and book appointments in real-time. Doctors can manage their profiles, set availability, view appointments, and add prescription notes. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB focusing on robust authentication and secure data management. 🔒
